**Talk Title**:  Design-Based Supervised Learning: A General Framework for Using LLM Annotations and Other Predicted Variables in Downstream Analyses

**Abstract**: In computational social science (CSS), researchers analyze documents to explain social and political phenomena. In most scenarios, CSS researchers first obtain labels for documents and then explain labels using interpretable regression analyses in the second step. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) can lower costs for CSS research by annotating documents cheaply at scale, but such surrogate labels are often imperfect and biased. We present a new algorithm for using outputs from LLMs for downstream statistical analyses while guaranteeing statistical properties—like asymptotic unbiasedness and proper uncertainty quantification—which are fundamental to CSS research. We show that direct use of LLM-predicted surrogate labels in downstream statistical analyses leads to substantial bias and invalid confidence intervals, even with high surrogate accuracy of 80-90%. Our approach guarantees valid inference for downstream statistical analyses, even when surrogates are arbitrarily biased, without requiring stringent assumptions, by controlling the probability of sampling documents for gold-standard labeling. The is talk is based on joint work with Naoki Egami, Musashi Hinck, and Hanying Wei.

**Bio**: Brandon M. Stewart is associate professor of Sociology and the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. He is the Co-Editor-in-Chief of Political Analysis and an Associate Editor at Sociological Methods & Research. His work develops new statistical methods for computational social science with a focus on text as data and causal inference. He is the co-author of Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences (PUP, 2022) and is the winner for earlier career awards from the Political Methodology Society (2023) and the American Sociological Association's Methodology Section (2024).
