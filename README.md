### Welcome to the **Metrics and Models** homepage!

Hi! We are a group of health and social data scientists located at the University of Oxford. This is a website dedicated to a new online, open seminar series which we're launching.

**Note**: This seminar series is in the pre-launch phase while we try to co-ordinate some of our first speakers!

**Frequency**: Every other Wednesday, starting July 2nd, 2025.

**Focus**: We have a focus on health and social data science. We're specifically interested -- but not exclusively -- in predictive methods (i.e., machine/deep learning, LLMs). We're also interested in the mathematical philosophy underpinning prediction, and efforts to make research more reproducible in general.

**Open to Everyone!** Importantly, this seminar series is open to *everyone*. We've tried to schedule it at a time of day that's hopefully roughly equitable to people in the Americas and Asia all the same.

**Time and Place**: The seminar series will be held online at 2pm UK time (GMT and BST).

**Registration**: To register, send a blank email or otherwise to metrics_and_models-subscribe [at] maillist.ox.ac.uk (replace the ' [at] ' with '@'), or see our maillist page [here](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/info/metrics_and_models).

**Interested in Presenting?**: If you're interested in presenting something to this seminar series, we have a form [here](https://forms.office.com/e/KsFZYcMz5C)!

**Off-weeks**: We'll be meeting in-person on the off-weeks, locally in Oxford, to discuss potential for collaboration and other opportunities. If you're interested in coming along to these offline meetings (or just want to chat), please get in touch with us at metrics_and_models_mgmt [at] maillist.ox.ac.uk.

**Who**: In alphabetical order, we are [Charlie](http://crahal.com/), [Claire](https://duiyidai.github.io/), [Daniel](https://github.com/dhvalden), [Jiani](http://vallerrr.github.io/), [Luc](https://rocher.lc/), [Mark](https://markverhagen.me/), [Ridhi](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/ridhi-kashyap), and [Xiaowen](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong). Our organisational team are part of the [Demographic Science Unit](https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/), [Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/), the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), and [Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/).
